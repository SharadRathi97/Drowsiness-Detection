# Drowsiness-Detection
A Python program using OpenCV - 3.0.0 along with the numpy and dlib libraries to detect if a person is feeling sleepy or not.

The program uses facial landmark features to detect faces in the frame, and then uses the value of euclidean distances between the eyelids, to detect if the eyes are closed or not.

The facial landmark feature dataset can be obtained from "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat" file. Since this file was more than 25MB, it could'nt be uploaded, but can be found online easily.
